/*!   
\brief The CameraDependentSettingInterface allows camera drivers to supply one open-ended, additional argument to the standard
       CameraDriverInterface::CCStartExposure function.  This offers camera drivers great flexibility in what the setting
	   does along with the available options.

\ingroup Interface

This interface is optional.  By default, TheSkyX will use the standard CCStartExposure defined in CameraDriverInterface.
However, many cameras support options which may be device-specific, or are otherwise unsupported by the default implementation
of acquiring an exposure. Examples might include RBI flush, or multiple data readout modes, specialized processing, etc.

This interface adds a single additional argument to the standard CCStartExposure function, and allows the camera driver to
dictate all available values or options for this argument.  TheSkyX will then allow the user to select between these options when
commanding an exposure with the user interface or through scripting.

As an example, a company named "XYZ" might use this interface to support enabling/disabling RBI:
- CCGetExtendedSettingName would return "XYZ RBI mode"
- CCGetExtendedValueCount would return 2
- CCGetExtendedValueName would return "No RBI" as nIndex == 0, and "Using RBI" as nIndex == 1.
- CCStartExposureAdditionalArgInterface would disable RBI if passed nIndex == 0, but would enable RBI if nIndex == 1.

If an older version of TheSkyX attaches to a driver implementing this interface, the standard CCStartExposure function
will be called.  By convention, this should be the equivalent of calling CCStartExposureAdditionalArgInterface with
nIndex == 0.

When an exposure is acquired when this interface is supported, the current setting (i.e. whatever option is currently selected)
is written to the FITS header under the FITS key "CDS" with the FITS comment "Camera dependent setting".

This interface was added in TheSky build 11525.

Don't forget to respond accordingly in your queryAbstraction().
